"""Frozen version stamps for the email-extract contracts (Turn 0.1).

Each constant is stamped onto the artifacts its contract produces (D12: a record
or citation is meaningless without its versions). Every docstring names what
moves that constant; nothing else in the package bumps it.

Resolved ambiguity 2 (schema-version relationship): the core codec envelope's
``schema_version`` is the core's own and stays untouched; ``OUTPUT_SCHEMA_VERSION``
is an ordinary field of the record and part of every cache key.
